# Python Project Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and run the Python project.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Git (optional, for version control)

## Setup Instructions

1. To create a virtual environment, run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

2. To activate the virtual environment manually (if needed):

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. To install the required packages, run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. To deactivate the virtual environment when done:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

## Running the Code

After setting up the environment, you can run your Python scripts using:

```bash
python your_script.py
```

## Dependencies

All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` and will be automatically installed during setup.
